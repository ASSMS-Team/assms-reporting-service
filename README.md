## Terraform Infrastructure

This repository owns only the Reporting Service VM, NIC, service-specific NSG, and optional public IP. Shared resource-group and services-subnet values are consumed from the platform Terraform remote state or supplied through explicit overrides; this repository does not recreate the shared VNet or subnets.
