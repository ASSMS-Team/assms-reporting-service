## Terraform Infrastructure

This repository owns only the Reporting Service VM, NIC, service-specific NSG, and optional public IP. Shared resource-group and services-subnet values are consumed from the platform Terraform remote state or supplied through explicit overrides; this repository does not recreate the shared VNet or subnets.

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs on pull requests targeting `dev` or `main` and pushes to `dev` or `main`. CI validates Terraform formatting and both environment roots, then restores and builds the .NET 8 solution in Release mode and runs its tests with the configured XPlat coverage collector. Mandatory failures fail CI; test results and coverage are retained as workflow artifacts. No deployment occurs from this workflow.
